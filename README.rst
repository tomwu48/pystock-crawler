Installation
------------

Prerequisites:

* Python 2.7

``pystock-crawler`` is based on Scrapy_, so you will also need to install
prerequisites such as lxml_ and libffi_ for Scrapy and its dependencies. On
Ubuntu, for example, you can install them like this::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y gcc python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev build-essential

See `Scrapy's installation guide`_ for more details.

After installing prerequisites, you can then install ``pystock-crawler`` with
``pip``::

    (sudo) pip install pystock-crawler


Quickstart
----------

**Example 1.** Fetch Google's and Yahoo's daily prices ordered by date::

    pystock-crawler prices GOOG,YHOO -o out.csv --sort

**Example 2.** Fetch daily prices of all companies listed in
``./symbols.txt``::

    pystock-crawler prices ./symbols.txt -o out.csv

**Example 3.** Fetch Facebook's fundamentals during 2013::

    pystock-crawler reports FB -o out.csv -s 20130101 -e 20131231

**Example 4.** Fetch fundamentals of all companies in ``./nyse.txt`` and direct
the log to ``./crawling.log``::

    pystock-crawler reports ./nyse.txt -o out.csv -l ./crawling.log

**Example 5.** Fetch all ticker symbols in NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX::

    pystock-crawler symbols NYSE,NASDAQ,AMEX -o out.txt


Usage
-----

Type ``pystock-crawler -h`` to see command help::

    Usage:
      pystock-crawler symbols <exchanges> (-o OUTPUT) [-l LOGFILE] [-w WORKING_DIR]
                                          [--sort]
      pystock-crawler prices <symbols> (-o OUTPUT) [-s YYYYMMDD] [-e YYYYMMDD]
                                       [-l LOGFILE] [-w WORKING_DIR] [--sort]
      pystock-crawler reports <symbols> (-o OUTPUT) [-s YYYYMMDD] [-e YYYYMMDD]
                                        [-l LOGFILE] [-w WORKING_DIR]
                                        [-b BATCH_SIZE] [--sort]
      pystock-crawler (-h | --help)
      pystock-crawler (-v | --version)

    Options:
      -h --help       Show this screen
      -o OUTPUT       Output file
      -s YYYYMMDD     Start date [default: ]
      -e YYYYMMDD     End date [default: ]
      -l LOGFILE      Log output [default: ]
      -w WORKING_DIR  Working directory [default: .]
      -b BATCH_SIZE   Batch size [default: 500]
      --sort          Sort the result

There are three commands available:

* ``pystock-crawler symbols`` grabs ticker symbol lists
* ``pystock-crawler prices`` grabs daily prices
* ``pystock-crawler reports`` grabs fundamentals

``<exchanges>`` is a comma-separated string that specifies the stock exchanges
you want to include. Current, NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX are supported.

The output file of ``pystock-crawler symbols`` can be used for ``<symbols>``
argument in ``pystock-crawler prices`` and ``pystock-crawler reports``
commands.

``<symbols>`` can be an inline string separated with commas or a text file
that lists symbols line by line. For example, the inline string can be
something like ``AAPL,GOOG,FB``. And the text file may look like this::

    # This line is comment
    AAPL    Put anything you want here
    GOOG    Since the text here is ignored
    FB

Use ``-o`` to specify the output file. For ``pystock-crawler symbols``
command, the output format is a simple text file. For
``pystock-crawler prices`` and ``pystock-crawler reports`` the output format
is CSV.

``-l`` is where the crawling logs go to. If not specified, the logs go to
stdout.

By default, the crawler uses the current directory as the working directory.
If you don't want to use the current directoy, you can specify it with ``-w``
option. The crawler keeps HTTP cache in a directory named ``.scrapy`` under
the working directory. The cache can save your time by avoid downloading the
same web pages. However, the cache can be quite huge. If you don't need it,
just delete the ``.scrapy`` directory after you've done crawling.

``-b`` option is only available to ``pystock-crawler reports`` command. It
allows you to split a large symbol list into smaller batches. This is actually
a workaround for an unresolved bug (#2). Normally you don't have to specify
this option. Default value (500) works just fine.

The rows in the output file are in an arbitrary order by default. Use
``--sort`` option to sort them by symbols and dates. But if you have a large
output file, don't use --sort because it will be slow and eat a lot of memory.


Developer Guide
---------------

Installing Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Running Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install test requirements::

    pip install -r requirements-test.txt

Then run the test::

    py.test

This will download the test data (a lot of XML/XBRL files) from from
`SEC EDGAR`_ on the fly, so it will take some time and disk space. The test
data is saved to ``pystock_crawler/tests/sample_data`` directory. It can be
reused on the next time you run the test. If you don't need them, just delete
the ``sample_data`` directory.
